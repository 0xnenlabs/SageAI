# Contributing

When it comes to open source, there are different ways you can contribute, all
of which are valuable. Here's few guidelines that should help you as you prepare
your contribution.

## Initial steps

Before you start working on a contribution, create an issue describing what you want to build. It's possible someone 
else is already working on something similar, or perhaps there is a reason that feature isn't implemented. 
The maintainers will point you in the right direction.

<!-- ## Submitting a Pull Request

- Fork the repo
- Clone your forked repository: `git clone git@github.com:{your_username}/SageAI.git`
- Create a new branch off the `main` branch: `git checkout -b your-feature-name`
- Implement your contributions (see the Development section for more information)
- Push your branch to the repo: `git push origin your-feature-name`
- Go to https://github.com/0xnenlabs/SageAI/compare and select the branch you just pushed in the "compare:" dropdown
- Submit the PR. The maintainers will follow up ASAP. -->

### Documentation

The SageAI documentation lives in the README.md. Be sure to document any API changes you implement.
